# User interface

The Configurator uses a simple and intuitive layout that is devided into 5 main areas:

- **ActivityBar** - Located on the far left-hand side the activity bar lets you switch between activity views like the controller explorer or configuration guide.
- **SideBar** - Contains different views based on the selected activity. For example, the object tree view for the controller explorer and the configuration steps for the configuration guide.
- **WorkArea** - Contains different views based on the selected activity. It is the main area for displaying and editing data.
- **Panel** - An additional space for views below the main work area.
- **StatusBar** - Information about the system and controllers state.
